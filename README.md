ASK DOCTOR ONLINE:

Our project basically focuses on connecting people deprived of health care 
in remote areas through digital media.

The Idea “Ask Doctor Online” is an platform that helps to aware citizen about health issues 
and their related problems.
ASK DOCTOR ONLINE will allow people to ask  and read solutions of health related questions to 
professional Doctors of India.
This platform works on the level that several professional doctors from all
 over the India can join our organisation and after verification they can use their medical
 experience in making India a healthy nation and answer their querr of patients.
The platform consists of making your own profile, in which you have to add your basic body 
specifications, i.e. weight, height, etc. This will generate a profile of the patient with a 
unique identity. Further once the patient is passed through the login procedure. 
He can access a multiple of options like “Ask a health query”, “Read a health query”, 
“Medicine Description”, “Tips for you” ,etc.


The doctors will answer the patient’s query immediately and answer will be 
notified to the respective patient . Further the queries will be saved and 
used for future references without the disclosure of the patient’s identity. 
In this way, many other patients can access the queries via the read a health query option.


Further the medicine which you are been suggested can be verified, known, its benefits, 
side effects everything will be available on our platform. 

E.g. Paracetamol
Uses: Counter Pain, Reduce Fever, Reduce Headaches, Minor Aches 
and Pains, Post-operative Pains

Side Effects: Liver Damage, Skin Reactions, Asthma, Kidney failure, Affects Pregnancy.


This platform will also allow citizen to register complain about health problem in their locality.
eg- I am from xyz village from maharahtra. There are sanitary problems due to lack of toilets 
due to which health issues occur a lot.
This complain will be given to government of india/NGO(if interested) and problem will be over taken by them

WHY ASK DOCTOR ONLINE? 
In India, ratio of doctor to patient is 1:1700 so providing doctor online will majorly help
patient to reach the doctors and discuss their helath problems.
